		Your name is Honda Accord. (Your parents gave you this name because they were driving by the Honda dealership on the way home from the Baby Factory.) Don't be fooled by this name; you are truly an ordinary human sitting in a very overcrowded, stale-aired classroom. 
		<br><br>
		Your eyes are focused on the mysterious text on the blackboard.

		Teacher: Students! Pay close attention to what is written on the board! <b>This is a very important exam.</b> Every one of you will be required to take it. It is not graded like your typical assignments. There is only two possible grades on this exam; you can either pass or fail. 
		<br>
		<br>If you fail the exam, you are never leaving this school. You will be sent back to "The Third Grade". None of you want that now, do you? I didn't think so.
		<br><br>
		Now, class, are there any questions before we move on?
