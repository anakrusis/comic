<h2>comic what is it?</h2>

</div>

<div class="bodydiv">

This is a webcomic heavily based on the format of the <a href="https://www.homestuck.com/stories">Ms paint adventures</a> by andrew hussie. It doesnt have a premise yet (I dont have anything in mind Im just going with the flow lol)<br><br>

Anyone can post in my discord channel on the sinecraft discord, what they would like to happen next. You can format the message like:<br><br>
> Words words words<br>
or <br>
> Do the thing<br>
so that we can tell what is a command and stuff..<br><br>

Everyone can react to the ones that they want to see be used in the comic. the one with the most people reacting to it (Note: not the most reactions) will be used in the next days comic! <br><br>

You can react to multiple responses if you like, and you can also post as many responses as you like, its just that only one will be used<br><br>

There will be a one day period to put your reactions in, and then the next panel will be drawed and uploaded to this site! I think thats all there is to it! : ))
