</div>

<div class="bodydiv">

This is a webcomic heavily based on the format of the <a href="https://www.homestuck.com/stories">Ms paint adventures</a> by andrew hussie. It doesnt have a premise yet (I dont have anything in mind Im just going with the flow lol)<br><br>

Voting is not currently going on but it may resume in the near future!
